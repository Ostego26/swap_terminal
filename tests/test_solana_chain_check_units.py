"""The parts of solana_chain_check.py that can be proven without a cluster.

Role: test (pure pieces of the operator diagnostic; no chain, no socket)
Reads: solana_chain_check.py
Writes: nothing
Can move funds: no
Mainnet-safe: yes

WHY ONLY THE PARTS. solana_chain_check.py's whole purpose is to meet a real
Solana cluster, and its value is precisely the thing that cannot be tested from
here -- whether the RPC response field names chains/solana.py expects are the
ones a cluster actually sends. Measured 2026-09-25: no Solana endpoint was
reachable from this environment (api.devnet.solana.com returns 403 from the
proxy) and solana-test-validator could not be installed.

So this covers what is provable without one: the genesis-hash-to-network
mapping, the exit codes, and the properties rule 14 asks of the output. The
same split tests/test_regtest_harness_units.py already makes for
regtest_htlc_verify.py -- "the parts that can be proven without a daemon."

THE GENESIS MAPPING IS THE ONE WORTH HAVING. The script identifies the network
from getGenesisHash rather than from the URL, because a cluster cannot lie
about its genesis and a hostname can. An operator with a "devnet" alias pointed
at mainnet would otherwise read the word devnet all the way to a real transfer.
If a hash in that table were wrong, mainnet would print as devnet.
